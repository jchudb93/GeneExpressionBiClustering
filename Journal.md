  - Refactoring: With the purpose of keeping the notebooks order, I decided to rename them with a number according to the research plan, this is: 1 for preprocessing, 2 for traditional clustering, 3 for biclustering and so on.
- Entry 01/12/2017
  - TT Clustering added: Using HDBSCAN I am clusetering the TT data without any preprocessing apart from itself, lets measure its efficiency.

  - Start using biclustering included in scikit-learn, first try with spectral coclustering
  - Trying to visualize the generated biclusters
  Suggestions:
  - Use .iloc instead of brackets
  - Use other colors in order to difference the biclusters

  - MSR implemantation
  - Looking for other solutions like a analysis of variance

  - Odibat notebook created
  - Differente coherence and correlations created. This ones were created so as to measure if exists a direct or an indirect relationship between vectors.
